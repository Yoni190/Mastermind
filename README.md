# Mastermind
Mastermind is a code breaking game for two players. The Code Maker(one who chooses colors) chooses four colors from a set of six colors. It is then the job of the Code Breaker to try to find the combination of colors that the Code Maker chose. 

Based on every set of guess, the Code Breaker gets a response on how close he was to the chosen pattern. A white circle means that one of the colors chosen by him is found in the code but is not in the right place. A black circle means that one of the colors is found in the code and is in the correct position.

This ruby program allows the user to either try and break the computers randomized code as the Code Breaker or have the computer break his code as the Code Maker.
